I received the Master degree in Computer Science in 2012 from the department of Computer Science of the University of Rome ‘‘La Sapienza’’, under the tutoring of Prof. Roberto Di Pietro. In September 2012 I moved to Barcelona and joined the Wireless Communications ([WiCom](http://wicom.upf.edu)) Research Group where I took my PhD with my thesis on "[Towards an Internet of Trust](https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/25746)" under the supervision of Prof. Vanesa Daza. In 2016 I moved to Paris where I joined the Nokia Bell Labs as a research engineer in the cyber-security department. 

My main research interest is privacy and security in distributed systems with a special focus on State Machine Replication systems (including blockchain technologies). Other research topics I am interested in include security and privacy of Virtualized and Cloud Systems and the possibility of efficiently leveraging mobile devices HW features to build better hardware security modules such as TPM or physical unclonable functions (PUFs).
