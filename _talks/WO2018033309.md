A method and system of detecting a security threat within a network of connected devices that share a ledger of transactions between them under the form of exchanged blockchain messages. Enhanced blockchain messages are built by adding all forked chains to the blockchain messages. Forked chains in such enhanced blockchains are then inspected to detect any anomaly. When an anomaly is detected in a forked chain, all transactions of the ledger in the forked chain and the blockchain message leading up to the network attack entry point are reviewed to identify the source of the security threat.
