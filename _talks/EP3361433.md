A system and method of interacting a first device in a first Island of Trust belonging to a first organization, such Island of Trust comprising at least a first backend, with a second device in a second Island of Trust belonging to a second organization, such Island of Trust comprising at least a second backend. First and second backends are connected to a cloud, and may read/write a payment blockchain and an obligation blockchain. The combined specific obligation blockchain with standard payment blockchain allows devices to commit to the ToUs for their respective organizations in a tamper evident distributed manner.
