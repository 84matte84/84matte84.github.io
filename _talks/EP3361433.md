A system and method of interacting a first device (12) in a first Island of Trust (10) belonging to a first organization (A), such Island of Trust comprising at least a first backend (11), with a second device (22) in a second Island of Trust (20) belonging to a second organization (B), such Island of Trust comprising at least a second backend (21). First and second backends are connected to a cloud (17), and may read/write a payment blockchain (15) and an obligation blockchain (16). The combined specific obligation blockchain (16) with standard payment blockchain (15) allows devices to commit to the ToUs for their respective organizations in a tamper evident distributed manner.
