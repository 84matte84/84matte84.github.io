A method and system of authenticating a device within a network of connected devices that share a ledger of transactions between them under the form of exchanged blockchain messages and comprising: computing a PoK chain (70) based on the enhanced blockchain, receiving an authentication request from an application or a device, the authentication request including one or more PoKs (71), retrieving from the PoK database the PoK chain (70) corresponding to the application or device identified in the authentication request; computing a PoK (71) based on the PoK chain (70) retrieved from the PoK database, comparing it with the PoK (71) included in the authentication request, and if they match, validating the authentication request.
