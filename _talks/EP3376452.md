A method of maintaining a transaction database in an electronic transfer network, the method improving privacy of the network by making it possible to discard older transactions by enforcing demurrage, the method comprising: verifying, the value of an input N ( t g ) of a new transaction is equal to the value of the output M ( t a ) it references, multiplied once by a demurrage rate r for every block between the past block B x storing the past transaction ( t a ) whose output M ( t a ) is referenced and the new block ( B z ): N t g = M t a r z x , z > x , 0 > r > 1 Verifying that the total value of the new transaction's outputs M ( t g ) is equal or inferior to the total value of the new transaction's inputs N ( t g ), if the condition is verified, validating the new block ( B z ).
