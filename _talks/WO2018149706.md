A network of connected devices share a ledger of payment transactions between them under the form of a standard payment blockchain. A specific obligation blockchain is added to the network, also shared by the connected devices, and a link is made between the standard payment blockchain and the specific obligation blockchain, to reflect payments made in relation to obligations. A distributed credit method is built on top of this infrastructure.
