A method and system of authenticating a device within a network of connected devices that share a ledger of transactions between them under the form of exchanged blockchain messages and comprising: computing a PoK chain based on the enhanced blockchain, receiving an authentication request from an application or a device, the authentication request including one or more PoKs, retrieving from the PoK database the PoK chain corresponding to the application or device identified in the authentication request; computing a PoK based on the PoK chain retrieved from the PoK database, comparing it with the PoK included in the authentication request, and if they match, validating the authentication request.
