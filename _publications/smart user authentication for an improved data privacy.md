Market analysis predicts that in a few years, companies, universities, government agencies as well as common people in they daily life will increasingly adopt mobile computing systems thus increasingly enjoying the benefits of online, Internet-based services. However, such scenario will also expose user data privacy to severe attacks. This situation has led to the development of authentication approaches aimed at preventing unauthorized access to user data. Many different authentication approaches have been proposed over the last years, starting from basic password to more complex biometric solutions but all of them have proven to suffer from the same weaknesses. This issue drove us to design a solution based upon hardware intrinsic security features and aimed at guaranteeing a high level of data privacy while providing a user friendly authentication process. Our solution shows advanced features of data privacy policies definition making it a good candidate for the construction of future data privacy policies.
