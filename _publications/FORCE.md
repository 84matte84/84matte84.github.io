Payment schemes based on mobile devices are expected to supersede traditional electronic payment approaches in the next few years. However, current solutions are limited in that protocols require at least one of the two parties to be on-line, i.e. connected either to a trusted third party or to a shared database. Indeed, in cases where customer and vendor are persistently or intermittently disconnected from the network, any on-line payment is not possible. This paper introduces FORCE, a novel mobile micro payment approach where all involved parties can be fully off-line. Our solution improves over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of payment flexibility and security. In fact, FORCE relies solely on local data to perform the requested operations. Present paper describes FORCE architecture, components and protocols. Further, a thorough analysis of its functional and security properties is provided showing its effectiveness and viability.
