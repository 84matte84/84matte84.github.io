Anomaly detection tools play a role of paramount importance in protecting networks and systems from unforeseen attacks, usually by automatically recognizing and filtering out anomalous activities. In this paper we present ADvISE: the first Anomaly Detection tool for blockchaIn SystEms which leverages blockchain meta-data, named forks, in order to collect potentially malicious requests in the network/system while being resilient to eclipse attacks. ADvISE collects and analyzes malicious forks to build a threat database that enables detection and prevention of future attacks.
