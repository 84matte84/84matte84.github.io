Cloud computing is nowadays a well-established computing model that provides many advantages to organizations (service providers and users) in terms of massive scalability, lower cost, and flexibility. The cloud computing paradigm has become a mainstream solution for the deployment of business processes and applications. In the public cloud vision, infrastructure, platform, and software services are provisioned on a pay-as-you-go basis [1]. Nevertheless, the level of service and the nonfunctional properties of cloud applications are still an open problem. In the past few years, the research community has been focusing on the nonfunctional aspects of the cloud paradigm, especially with respect to security aspects. However, despite these technical and economical benefits, many potential cloud consumers are still hesitant to adopt cloud computing due to security and privacy concerns.
